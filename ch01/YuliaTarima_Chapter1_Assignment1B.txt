This program simulates a Magic 8 Ball.
It creates a file with predefined responses, reads these responses,
prompts the user for a yes/no question,
and displays a random response until the user decides to quit.

Variables:
responses
  stores the list of predefined responses.
file
  represents the file object for 8ball_responses.txt during operations.
question
  stores the user's yes/no question and checks for the quit condition.

Functions:
The read_responses_file_into_list function
  opens the 8ball_responses.txt file and reads its contents
  into a list, splitting lines by newline characters.
The create_responses_file function
  creates a file named 8ball_responses.txt
  and writes a list of predefined Magic 8 Ball responses to it.
The magic_8_ball is the main function
  orchestrating the entire process of simulating the Magic 8 Ball toy.
  It calls the above functions to set up the responses
  by creating a file with predefined responses,
  a then reading these responses into a list.
  It then enters a loop where it interacts with the user
  by prompting them to ask a yes/no question.
  If the user types 'quit', the loop breaks, and the program ends.
  Otherwise, a random response is selected from the list
  and displayed to the user.
