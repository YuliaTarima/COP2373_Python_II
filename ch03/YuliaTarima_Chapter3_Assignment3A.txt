This application prompts for a list of user's monthly expenses:
first, type of expense and then the amount.
It uses the reduce method to analyze the expenses
and display the total expense,
the highest expense and the lowest expense.
It labels what is the highest and lowest expense.

Variables:
    get_expenses Function:
        expenses (list of tuples)
            Stores the list of expenses where each expense is a tuple
            containing the expense type and amount.
        expense_type (string)
            Temporarily holds the expense type entered by the user.
        amount (float)
            Temporarily holds the expense amount entered by the user.
    analyze_expenses Function:
        total_expense (float)
            Stores the total amount of all expenses.
        highest_expense (tuple (string, float))
            Stores the tuple of the highest expense (type, amount).
        lowest_expense(tuple (string, float))
            Stores the tuple of the lowest expense (type, amount).
    main Function:
        expenses (list of tuples)
            Receives list of expenses from get_expenses function.
        total (float)
            Receives total amount of all expenses
            from analyze_expenses function.
        highest (tuple (string, float))
            Receives the tuple of the highest expense
            from analyze_expenses function.
        lowest (tuple (string, float))
            Receives the tuple of the lowest expense
            from analyze_expenses function.

Functions:
    get_expenses
        Collects user input for expense type and amount.
        Adds each expense as a tuple to the expenses list.
        Returns the list of expenses.
    analyze_expenses
        Uses reduce to calculate the total expense.
        Uses reduce to find the highest expense.
        Uses reduce to find the lowest expense.
        Returns the total, highest, and lowest expenses.
    main
        Calls get_expenses to get the list of expenses.
        Calls analyze_expenses
        to get the total, highest, and lowest expenses.
        Prints the total, highest, and lowest expenses.
