1. Summary:
    The Poker Card Drawing Program simulates a card drawing system for a poker game.
    It allows users to:

        Replace selected cards with new ones until the deck is empty.
        Handle deck exhaustion and reshuffling of discard piles.

            Utilizes Unicode symbols and character representations for card suits and ranks.
        Game Functions:
            Handles dealing hands, printing hands, and replacing cards.
    2.2 Data Structures
        Deck:
            List of strings representing cards, with each card formatted as <Rank><Suit>.
        Hand:
            List of strings representing the current hand of cards.
    2.3 Dependencies

                Updated list of cards in hand.

4. Program Workflow
    Initialization:
        Create an instance of Deck.
        Deal an initial hand of 5 cards.
    Hand Management:
        Print the initial hand.
        Prompt the user to specify which cards to replace.
        Continuously draw and replace cards until the deck is exhausted.
    Card Drawing:
        Replace specified cards and handle cases where the deck or discard pile is empty.
        Print the updated hand after card replacements.

5. Example Usage
    # Initialize the deck
    deck = Deck()

    # Deal the initial hand
    hand = deal_hand()

    # Print the initial hand
    print_hand(hand)

    # Replace cards until the deck is empty
    hand = replace_cards(hand, deck)

    # Print the final hand after drawing new cards
    print("\nAfter drawing new cards:")
    print_hand(hand)

6. Error Handling
    Deck Exhaustion:
        If the deck is empty and no discards are available,
        the program will notify the user and stop further actions.
    Invalid Input:
        The program prompts the user until valid positions (1-5)
        are entered for card replacement.
7. Limitations and Assumptions
    Single Deck:
        The program uses a single deck of 52 cards
        without additional decks or jokers.
    Basic Poker Rules:
        The program does not implement specific poker hand rankings
        or betting rounds.
    Input Handling:
        Assumes the user enters integers between 1 and 5
        for card positions.
