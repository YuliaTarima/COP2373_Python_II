This application prompts the user for a phone number,
SSN, and zip code to be entered in a specific format.
Then it validates the entries using regular expressions
and displays the validation results to the user.

Variables:
    phone (in validate_phone_number function):
        Purpose: To hold the phone number input provided by the user for validation.
        Type: String
    phone (in main function):
        Purpose: To hold the phone number input provided by the user.
        Type: String
    ssn (in validate_ssn function):
        Purpose: To hold the social security number input provided by the user for validation.
        Type: String
    ssn (in main function):
        Purpose: To hold the social security number input provided by the user.
        Type: String
    zip_code (in validate_zip_code function):
        Purpose: To hold the zip code input provided by the user for validation.
        Type: String
    zip_code (in main function):
        Purpose: To hold the zip code input provided by the user.
        Type: String
    pattern (in validate_phone_number, validate_ssn, and validate_zip_code functions):
        Purpose: To store the compiled regular expression pattern used for matching the input data.
        Type: Compiled regular expression pattern (re.Pattern)

Functions:
    validate_phone_number
        Purpose: To validate a phone number using a regular expression pattern.
        Parameters: phone - a string representing the phone number to be validated.
        Returns: True if the phone number matches the pattern, otherwise False.
        Description: This function uses a regular expression to check if the phone
        number follows the format XXX-XXX-XXXX.
    validate_ssn
        Purpose: To validate a social security number (SSN) using a regular expression pattern.
        Parameters: ssn - a string representing the SSN to be validated.
        Returns: True if the SSN matches the pattern, otherwise False.
        Description: This function uses a regular expression to check if the SSN follows
        the format XXX-XX-XXXX.
    validate_zip_code
        Purpose: To validate a zip code using a regular expression pattern.
        Parameters: zip_code - a string representing the zip code to be validated.
        Returns: True if the zip code matches the pattern, otherwise False.
        Description: This function uses a regular expression to check if the zip code
        follows the formats XXXXX or XXXXX-XXXX.
    main
        Purpose: To get input from the user for phone number, SSN, and zip code, and display
        whether each is valid.
        Parameters: None
        Returns: None
        Description: This function prompts the user to enter a phone number, SSN, and zip code.
        It then validates each input using the respective validation functions and prints
        whether each input is valid or not.

Code Flow Summary:
    1. Program Start: The program starts execution from the main function.
    2. Input Phase: Collect phone number, SSN, and zip code from the user.
        The program prompts the user to enter three different pieces of information:
            - Phone number in the format XXX-XXX-XXXX
            - Social security number (SSN) in the format XXX-XX-XXXX
            - Zip code in the format XXXXX or XXXXX-XXXX
        These inputs are stored in variables phone, ssn, and zip_code, respectively.
    3. Validation Phase: Validate each input using respective functions with regular expressions.
        The entered phone number is passed to the validate_phone_number function,
        SSN - to the validate_ssn function, and zip code - to the validate_zip_code function.
        All three function validate based on the regular expression match,
        and return True for match or False otherwise.
    4. Output Phase: Display validation results for each input.
        The validation results for the user entered phone number, SSN, and zip code
        are displayed based on the return value from validate_phone_number,
        validate_ssn, and validate_zip_code.
    5. End: Program completes execution.
        After displaying the validation results,
        the main function completes its execution, and the program terminates.
