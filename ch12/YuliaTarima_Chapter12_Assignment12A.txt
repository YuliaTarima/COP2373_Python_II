Overview
    This program is designed to process and analyze student exam grades
    stored in a CSV file.
    It utilizes Python and the NumPy library to perform statistical
    calculations and format the results in a clear and readable
    tabular format that is easy to interpret.
    The code is modular, making it easy to maintain and extend.

Objectives
    Load student exam grades from a CSV file into a NumPy array.
    Print the first 3 rows of data in a tabular format.
    Calculate and print the following statistics for each exam:
        Mean (average)
        Median
        Standard deviation
        Minimum
        Maximum
    Calculate and print overall statistics across all exams combined.
    Determine and print the number of students who passed and failed each exam.
    Calculate and print the overall pass percentage across all exams.

Design
    1. Load Data
    Function:
        load_data(filename)
    Description:
        Load data from a CSV file and return it as a NumPy array.
        Utilizes np.genfromtxt to read the CSV file and skip
        the header row.
        Only the columns corresponding to exam grades
        (Exam 1, Exam 2, Exam 3) are loaded.
    Input:
        CSV filename
    Output:
        NumPy array containing exam grades

    2. Calculate Statistics
        Function:
            calculate_statistics(exam_grades)
        Description:
            Uses NumPy functions to calculate the required statistics
            (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum)
            for a given set of exam grades.
        Input:
            NumPy array of exam grades
        Output:
            Returns the calculated statistics as a NumPy array
            for easy manipulation and printing.

    3. Format Statistics Table
        Function:
            format_statistics_table(statistics, exam_names, table_title)
        Description:
            Format and print statistics in a tabular format.
            Dynamically adjusts the column widths
            to ensure proper alignment.
        Input:
            statistics: List of statistics for each exam
            exam_names: List of exam names
            table_title: Title of the table
        Output: Printed table of statistics

    4. Format Pass/Fail Table
        Function:
            format_pass_fail_table(pass_fail_stats, exam_names)
        Description:
            Format and print pass/fail statistics in a tabular format
            to clearly distinguishes between the number of students
            who passed and failed each exam.
        Input:
            pass_fail_stats: List of pass/fail counts for each exam
            exam_names: List of exam names
        Output:
            Printed table of pass/fail statistics

    5. Main Function
        Function:
            main()
        Description:
            Main function to orchestrate the loading of data,
            calculation of statistics, and printing of results.
            Provides clear and formatted output
            for easy interpretation of the data.
        Input:
            None
        Output:
            Printed tables of data and statistics
